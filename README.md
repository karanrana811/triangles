# triangles
 
used vanillaJS to create 4 web apps that : 
1. calculates if the angles entered by the user would form a triangle.
2. calculates the area of a triangle (using Heron's formula) whose sides are entered by the user.
3. calculates the hypotenuse of a triangle whose sides are entered by the user.
4. tests the user on their knowledge about triangles, and gives a score out of ten.
